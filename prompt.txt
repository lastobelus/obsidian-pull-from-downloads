You are an expert TypeScript developer building an Obsidian desktop plugin. Work in *full auto* mode and make reasonable assumptions instead of asking questions. Your goal is to produce a working plugin in this repo, including all code, config, and docs needed to build and install it in Obsidian.

### High-level goal

Build an Obsidian plugin that lets the user quickly “pull” a recent file from their Downloads folder into a chosen folder in the vault via the file explorer context menu.

Key user story:

- The user right-clicks on a folder (or a file) in the Obsidian file explorer.
- A custom context menu item appears (e.g. “Pull from Downloads…”).
- When the user clicks it:
  - The plugin shows a list of the most recent N files (default 10) from a configurable “Downloads” directory (default `~/Downloads`).
  - The user picks one file from this list.
  - The plugin then moves or copies that file (behavior configurable; default to **move**) into the target folder:
    - If the user initiated the action on a folder: use that folder.
    - If initiated on a file: use the file’s enclosing folder.
  - If the chosen file is a `.zip`, the plugin **extracts** it into the target folder instead of just copying/moving the zip itself.

The intent is to make it easy to pull single files *or* AI-generated multi-file zips (containing directories and multiple files) from `~/Downloads` into the vault with a couple of clicks.

### Required features

1. **Context menu integration**
   - Add a file explorer context menu item that appears for:
     - Folders.
     - Files (in which case you use the file’s parent folder).
   - Label suggestion: `Pull from Downloads…`.
   - When invoked, open a modal or dialog showing a list of candidate files from the configured download directory.

2. **Listing and filtering Downloads**
   - Read contents of the configured Downloads directory (default `~/Downloads`).
   - Sort files by **last modified time descending** (newest first).
   - Only include **files**, not directories.
   - Limit to `N` files where `N` is configurable (default 10).
   - Support an optional **whitelist** and **blacklist** of file extensions:
     - Whitelist: if non-empty, only include files whose extension is in the whitelist.
     - Blacklist: if non-empty, exclude files whose extension is in the blacklist.
     - Whitelist takes precedence over blacklist if both are configured.
     - Extensions should be matched case-insensitively and accept user input like `.zip` or `zip`.

3. **Selection UX**
   - Use a standard Obsidian modal or suggestion modal pattern where the user can:
     - See a list of recent files from the configured Downloads directory.
     - See at least filename and last modified time (human-readable). File size is a nice bonus if easy.
     - Click to select a file.
     - Cancel if they change their mind.
   - On cancel, do nothing and close cleanly.

4. **File operations**
   - When the user selects a file:
     - Determine the target folder based on the context-click:
       - If the context item was a folder: use that folder.
       - If the context item was a file: use that file’s parent folder.
     - Behavior depends on extension:
       - If the selected file has `.zip` extension:
         - **Extract** the contents into the target folder.
         - Use a Node-compatible zip library (e.g., `adm-zip` or similar) that works in Obsidian’s Electron environment.
         - Handle errors gracefully (e.g., invalid zip) via a visible notice.
       - Otherwise:
         - Move or copy the file into the target folder depending on the plugin setting:
           - Default: **move** (remove original from Downloads).
           - Alternative: **copy** (leave original in Downloads).
     - After the operation:
       - Refresh the Obsidian file explorer so new files/folders appear.
       - Show a brief notice like: `Pulled <filename> into <folder>`.

5. **Settings tab**
   - Implement a standard Obsidian settings tab for this plugin with the following options:
     - **Downloads directory** (string):
       - Default: `~/Downloads`.
       - Support `~` expansion.
     - **Number of files to list** (integer):
       - Default: `10`.
       - Minimum: `1`.
       - Maximum: `100` (reasonable upper bound).
     - **Behavior** (move or copy):
       - Options: `Move` (default), `Copy`.
     - **Whitelist extensions** (string):
       - Comma-separated or space-separated list.
       - Empty string means “no whitelist”.
     - **Blacklist extensions** (string):
       - Same parsing rules as whitelist.
       - Empty string means “no blacklist”.
   - Normalize and validate settings:
     - Trim whitespace.
     - Normalize extensions to consistently include or strip the leading dot internally.
     - Handle invalid numeric input with fallbacks to defaults.

6. **Zip extraction specifics**
   - For `.zip` files:
     - Extract into the target folder without prompting for an extra subfolder (unless the zip itself contains a top-level folder).
     - For filename collisions:
       - Either overwrite existing files OR add a suffix (e.g. `-1`, `-2`) to avoid collisions.
       - Pick one consistent strategy and document it in the README.
     - Surface extraction errors using Obsidian’s notice system.

7. **Error handling & robustness**
   - Handle common error cases gracefully:
     - Downloads directory doesn’t exist or is empty: show a friendly message instead of crashing.
     - No files pass filters: show “No matching files found”.
     - Permission issues or file operation errors: show a notice with enough detail for a user to debug.
   - Use Obsidian’s `Notice` or similar to surface problems.

8. **Documentation for the user**
   - Create a concise `README.md` that covers:
     - What the plugin does (one-paragraph overview).
     - How to install it:
       - `npm install` (or `pnpm install` / `yarn`; pick one and standardize).
       - `npm run build` (or equivalent).
       - Where to copy the built plugin for manual install:
         - Typically `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>`.
     - How to use:
       - Right-click a folder or file in the file explorer.
       - Choose `Pull from Downloads…`.
       - Choose a recent file from the Downloads list.
       - If it’s a zip, the plugin extracts it into the folder; otherwise it moves/copies it into the folder.
     - How this helps with AI-generated outputs:
       - Explain that users can have an AI tool create a **zip** containing multiple files and subfolders, save it to `~/Downloads`, then use this plugin to “pull” that zip into a chosen folder and extract it.
       - Emphasize that this makes AI-generated multi-file structures easy to bring into Obsidian.

### Implementation details and expectations

- Use **TypeScript** and follow the style of the official Obsidian sample plugin:
  - `main.ts`
  - `manifest.json`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - `package.json`
  - `styles.css`
  - Build script.
- Choose a reasonable plugin ID and name, for example:
  - ID: `pull-from-downloads`
  - Name: `Pull from Downloads`
- Ensure all imports and plugin metadata are valid for Obsidian.
- Use Node’s filesystem APIs (available in Obsidian’s Electron environment) for file operations and zip handling.
- Include any minimal type declarations needed so `tsc` does not error.
- Provide a simple `npm run build` script in `package.json` that builds the plugin into the structure Obsidian expects.
- Write clean, commented code for the core logic (especially listing/filtering files and handling move/copy vs zip extraction).

### Output requirements

- Create all necessary files in the repo, including but not limited to:
  - `manifest.json`
  - `package.json`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - `main.ts`
  - `styles.css` (can be minimal)
  - `README.md`
  - Any helper modules you deem useful (e.g., for path handling or zip extraction).
- Ensure the project can be installed and built with:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run build`
- Do not ask me any questions; choose reasonable defaults and implement the full plugin.

When you are done, summarize the file structure and any build/install steps in a brief final message.
