## Usage Guide

This guide covers everyday usage, settings, and best practices.

### Basic Workflow
1. Right-click a folder (or file).
2. Select **Pull from Downloads…**
3. Choose a recent file. ZIPs extract; files copy/move.

### Ideal With AI Zips
Tell your AI:
> "Please emit the output as a ZIP into my Downloads folder."

Then pull it directly into your vault.

### Settings Explained
**Downloads directory** — default `~/Downloads`  
**Number of items** — default 10  
**Move or Copy** — choose behavior  
**Whitelist** — show only certain extensions  
**Blacklist** — hide certain extensions  
**Extract ZIPs** — on by default  
**Collision handling** — version or overwrite

### Tips & Best Practices
- Keep Downloads tidy for faster selection.
- Use whitelists to reduce noise.
- Use subfolders in vault to organize extracted bundles.
