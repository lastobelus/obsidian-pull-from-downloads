# Using AI-Generated ZIP Files with Obsidian Pull-from-Downloads

This guide shows how to use the **Pull from Downloads** Obsidian plugin to bring
multi-file ZIPs (or regular files) generated by your AI chat agent directly into
your vault with just a couple of clicks.

## 1. Ask your AI to emit a ZIP

Whenever you need multiple files, images, or a directory structure, ask your AI:

> “Please bundle the output as a ZIP file and save it to my Downloads folder.”

Most agents can do this automatically.

## 2. Right‑click where you want the files
In Obsidian’s file explorer:
- Right‑click a folder → choose **Pull from Downloads…**
- Or right‑click a file → the plugin uses the file’s parent folder.

## 3. Pick the file from your Downloads
The plugin shows your most recent downloads (10 by default).  
Selecting a ZIP automatically extracts it into the target folder.

## 4. Optional: Configure to taste
Under plugin settings:
- Choose move vs copy  
- Adjust how many recent files to display  
- Add whitelist/blacklist file extensions  
- Set a custom Downloads directory  

## That’s all!
This keeps your vault tidy, and lets you pull AI-generated artifacts into the
right place with no drag‑and‑drop, no digging, no fuss.
