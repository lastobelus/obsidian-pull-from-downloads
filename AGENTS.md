# Agent Operating Notes

- If the user's prompt contains questions, **respond with answers first** before running commands or making repo changes. After answering, proceed with implementation as needed.
- Use `npm run install:local` with `OBSIDIAN_VAULT` set when installing into a vault.
- Keep commits conventional; push to `origin/development`.
